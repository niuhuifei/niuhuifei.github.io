      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, this is my new site mainly write in English on researches I am working on. I will continously update work and publications in our lab mainly through this website.I am a plant researcher currently living in Guangzhou, China  Guangzhou is in the south part of China, with a very high diversity of plants, particularly evergreen plants. Thus here you cannot feel any autumn or winter style of plants with yellow leaves. There is a big botanical garden here: the south China Botanical Garden, Chinese Academic of Sciences. Now I am working in this beautiful garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many different plants living on the earth, but how they evolve is a big and an interesting question. Particularly, they can grow in very diversified environments with developing of varialbe traits even in a very short time. Plants are the main resource our own species need to use and feed us. With the incresing size of population, we need more different wild plant resources to make sustainable developments, this drive us to further understanding the evolution and divesification of plants around us.&lt;/p&gt;
